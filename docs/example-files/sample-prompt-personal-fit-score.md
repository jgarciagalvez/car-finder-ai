## Analysis Instructions

1. **Budget Alignment** (25% weight)
   - Compare vehicle price against buyer's budget range
   - Consider if the price leaves room for potential repairs/maintenance
   - Evaluate overall value proposition

2. **Feature Match** (30% weight)
   - Calculate percentage of preferred features present
   - Identify any critical missing features
   - Note any unexpected premium features as bonus points

3. **Use Case Fit** (25% weight)
   - Evaluate if vehicle type/characteristics suit stated use case
   - Consider practical aspects (fuel efficiency for commuting, space for family, etc.)
   - Assess age/mileage appropriateness for intended use

4. **Priority Factors Alignment** (20% weight)
   - Weight the analysis based on buyer's stated priorities
   - Give extra consideration to factors the buyer emphasized
   - Flag any misalignments with priority factors

5. **Overall Synthesis**
   - Combine all factors into holistic 0-10 score
   - Provide clear reasoning for the score
   - Identify key strengths and concerns

## Scoring Rubric

- **9-10 (Exceptional)**: Meets or exceeds all major criteria. Minor compromises at most. Strong recommendation.
- **7-8 (Strong)**: Meets most criteria with some minor compromises. Generally good fit with manageable trade-offs.
- **5-6 (Moderate)**: Some criteria met but notable gaps. Acceptable if buyer is flexible on certain points.
- **3-4 (Weak)**: Major criteria mismatches. Significant compromises required. Consider alternatives.
- **0-2 (Poor)**: Fundamentally wrong for buyer. Does not meet basic requirements.
