## **üìã OLX Scraping Issues & Solutions Summary**

### **üö® Issues Identified with OLX Scraping**

#### **1. Missing Dynamic Content**
- **Problem**: `window.__PRERENDERED_STATE__` variable doesn't exist in scraped HTML
- **Evidence**: Manual browser inspection shows the variable exists, but Puppeteer scraping doesn't capture it
- **Impact**: Cannot extract vehicle data using the JSON method

#### **2. Lazy Loading Architecture**
- **Problem**: OLX uses infinite scroll/lazy loading instead of traditional pagination
- **Evidence**: User confirmed that OLX loads more content as you scroll down
- **Impact**: Our pagination-based scraping approach doesn't work

#### **3. Anti-Bot Measures**
- **Problem**: Suspected bot detection preventing dynamic content from loading
- **Evidence**: 
  - Enhanced scraper with 10+ second waits still doesn't get dynamic content
  - Basic HTML shell loads but JavaScript-generated content doesn't appear
- **Impact**: Headless browser may be detected and blocked

#### **4. JavaScript Execution Timing**
- **Problem**: Dynamic content loads after our wait periods
- **Evidence**: Even with `networkidle0` and extended waits, content doesn't appear
- **Impact**: Cannot reliably capture the full page state

### **üí° Possible Solutions to Try**

#### **üîß Immediate Solutions (High Success Probability)**

1. **CSS Selector Fallback**
   - Switch `parser-schema.json` back to `"method": "css"`
   - Update selectors to match current OLX HTML structure
   - Extract visible content instead of JSON data
   - **Pros**: Works with whatever content loads
   - **Cons**: Less rich data, more fragile

2. **API Endpoint Discovery**
   - Investigate OLX's internal API endpoints using browser dev tools
   - Find AJAX calls that load vehicle data
   - Scrape API directly instead of HTML pages
   - **Pros**: More reliable, richer data
   - **Cons**: Requires reverse engineering, may change

#### **üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Solutions (Medium Success Probability)**

3. **Enhanced Browser Stealth**
   - Use `puppeteer-extra` with stealth plugin
   - Implement more sophisticated bot detection evasion
   - Randomize browser fingerprints and behaviors
   - **Implementation**: Add stealth plugins to `ScraperService`

4. **Scroll-Based Loading**
   - Implement infinite scroll simulation
   - Trigger lazy loading by scrolling to bottom of page
   - Wait for new content to load progressively
   - **Implementation**: Add scroll automation to `ScraperService`

5. **User Session Simulation**
   - Use real browser cookies/sessions
   - Implement human-like interaction patterns
   - Add random delays and mouse movements
   - **Implementation**: Enhance `ScraperService` with session management

#### **üî¨ Research Solutions (Lower Success Probability)**

6. **Headless Browser Alternatives**
   - Try Playwright instead of Puppeteer
   - Use Selenium with different drivers
   - Test with real browser automation (non-headless)

7. **Proxy Rotation**
   - Implement rotating proxy servers
   - Use residential IP addresses
   - Distribute requests across multiple IPs

### **üìù Implementation Notes for Future Team**

#### **üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status**
- ‚úÖ **Otomoto**: Fully working with JSON extraction method
- ‚úÖ **Source Selection**: Can configure `enabledSources` in `search-config.json`
- ‚úÖ **Smart Pagination**: Stops when hitting existing vehicles
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: All interfaces properly aligned with `Vehicle` schema
- ‚ùå **OLX**: JSON method fails, needs alternative approach

#### **üîß Code Locations for OLX Fixes**

1. **Parser Configuration**: `parser-schema.json` (lines 46-102)
2. **JSON Extraction**: `apps/api/src/services/ParserService.ts` (lines 102-137)
3. **Dynamic Content Waiting**: `apps/api/src/services/ScraperService.ts` (lines 198-220)
4. **Search-Only Pipeline**: `packages/scripts/src/ingest.ts` (lines 188-261)

#### **üß™ Testing Setup**
- **Debug HTML**: Scraper saves HTML to `docs/example-files/olx-search-page-scraped.html`
- **Example Files**: Compare with `olx-search-page-example.html` (working structure)
- **Configuration**: Toggle sources in `search-config.json`

#### **üìä Success Metrics**
- **Target**: Extract vehicle data from OLX search pages
- **Expected Data**: Title, price, year, mileage, seller info, photos
- **Current Status**: 0 vehicles extracted (vs. working example with 37 vehicles)

### **üéØ Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Short Term (MVP Focus)**:
   - Keep OLX disabled: `"enabledSources": ["otomoto"]`
   - Focus on perfecting Otomoto pipeline
   - Implement LLM analysis and frontend features

2. **Medium Term (OLX Integration)**:
   - Try CSS selector fallback approach first
   - Investigate OLX API endpoints
   - Implement enhanced stealth measures

3. **Long Term (Robust Solution)**:
   - Consider professional scraping services
   - Implement multiple fallback strategies
   - Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting
