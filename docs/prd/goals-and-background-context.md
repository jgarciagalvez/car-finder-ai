# Goals and Background Context

### Goals

*   **Automate Search:** Drastically reduce the time and manual effort required to find relevant vehicle listings by automating the daily aggregation from multiple online sources.
*   **Improve Decision-Making:** Equip the user with clear, data-driven insights—including a Personal Fit Score, objective Market Value Analysis, and an AI-generated Virtual Mechanic's Report—to build confidence and identify the best deals.
*   **Centralize Workflow:** Provide a single, unified interface to manage all aspects of the vehicle search, from initial discovery to tracking seller communications and personal notes.
*   **Enable a Successful Purchase:** The ultimate goal is to enable the user to efficiently find and purchase a qualifying vehicle that meets their specific, complex criteria.
*   **Timeline:** Have a functional MVP ready by the end of the week (October 10th, 2025).

### Success Metrics

*   **Efficiency:** Reduce the time to review daily new vehicle listings from ~45 minutes (manual estimate) to under 5 minutes.
*   **Effectiveness:** The tool should not miss any relevant vehicles that would have been found through a manual search.
*   **Primary Outcome:** The user successfully purchases a vehicle found and tracked using the application.

### User Persona

The primary user is the project's developer, a technically proficient individual building this tool for personal use. The goal is to find a specific vehicle that meets a complex set of criteria, while minimizing the time spent on manual, repetitive searching.

### Background Context

The search for a specific used vehicle in Poland is a fragmented and inefficient process, requiring manual checks across multiple marketplaces like Otomoto.pl and OLX.pl. This leads to disorganized tracking, difficulty in comparing vehicles objectively, and a lack of readily available, model-specific mechanical knowledge.

This project aims to solve that problem by creating a personal, automated application. It will act as a "mission control" for the vehicle search, providing the user with aggregated listings, intelligent scoring, and AI-powered analysis to streamline the entire process from discovery to purchase.
