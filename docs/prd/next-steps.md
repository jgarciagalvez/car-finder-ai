# Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review this PRD, particularly the **User Interface Design Goals** section (Goals, Key Interaction Paradigms, Core Screens). Create detailed UI/UX specifications, wireframes, and interaction flows that fulfill the vision and requirements defined here. Focus on the "mission control" dashboard concept and the card-based vehicle presentation model.

### Architect Prompt

Review this PRD comprehensively, including all **Functional Requirements** (FR1-FR14), **Non-Functional Requirements** (NFR1-NFR5), and **Technical Assumptions**. Create a detailed architecture document that defines:
- System architecture and component structure
- Database schema and data models
- API specifications and service interfaces
- Technology stack implementation details
- Testing strategy and quality assurance approach

Ensure the architecture supports the Local-First Execution Model and maintains the near-zero operational cost constraint while enabling all required AI-powered features.
