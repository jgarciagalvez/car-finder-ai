# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
The application's user experience should be that of a powerful, data-rich analysis tool. The vision is a "mission control" dashboard that presents complex information in a clean, scannable, and actionable format. The focus is on efficiency, clarity, and empowering the user to make quick, informed decisions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
* **Card-Based Layout:** The main view will use a card for each vehicle, presenting key information at a glance.
* **Direct Manipulation:** The user should be able to perform primary actions—like changing a vehicle's status or adding a quick note—directly from its card on the dashboard.
* **Hover-to-Preview:** Image carousels on the dashboard cards should be interactive on mouse hover.
* **Fast Navigation:** The application should feel like a Single-Page App (SPA), with near-instant navigation between the main dashboard and the detailed view.

### Core Screens and Views
1.  **Dashboard View:** The primary screen, featuring a grid or list of vehicle cards with powerful sorting and filtering controls.
2.  **Detail View:** A comprehensive page for a single vehicle, containing all scraped data, AI reports, comments, and the communication assistant.

### Accessibility
* **Accessibility:** None. Formal accessibility compliance is not a requirement for this personal-use application.

### Branding
* A clean, minimalist, "data-tool" aesthetic is preferred, potentially with a dark mode theme. No formal branding is required.

### Target Device and Platforms
* **Target Device and Platforms:** Web Responsive, but primarily optimized for a desktop/laptop browser.
