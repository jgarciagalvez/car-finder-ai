# Non-Functional Requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Internal service with trusted data sources. Minimal SQL injection risk (data from DB, not user input). Future API exposure will require input validation."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent performance characteristics. Single query per vehicle, in-memory calculations. Estimated <50ms per vehicle. Batch-processing optimized."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Robust error handling with continue-on-failure strategy. Graceful degradation (returns null on errors). Defensive coding for edge cases (division by zero, missing data)."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Exceptional maintainability. Clear code structure, comprehensive JSDoc comments, consistent patterns. Post-MVP algorithm documented for future enhancement."
