# Translation Extraction & Pipeline Optimization

schema: 1
story: "2.4c"
story_title: "Translation Extraction & Pipeline Optimization"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Strong implementation with all ACs met, but test infrastructure has minor mocking issues that need resolution before merge. Code quality is excellent."

    medium: 1  # TEST-001
    low: 2     # TEST-002, TEST-003

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Resolve Jest mocking failures before merge"
    monitor:
      - "Track test coverage as pipeline grows"
      - "Watch for Windows-specific test failures"

# Strengths (for learning/documentation)
strengths:
  - "Excellent architectural separation - translation cleanly extracted"
  - "Configuration-driven design via search-config.json"
  - "Backward compatible AIService changes"
  - "Comprehensive unit test coverage for core logic (14/16 tests passing)"
  - "Resume logic preserved and enhanced with force flag"
  - "Structured logging improves observability"
  - "API endpoints enable UI integration"
  - "Follows established patterns from Story 2.4b"

# QA actions taken
qa_refactoring:
  - file: "packages/db/src/__tests__/vehicleRepository.integration.test.ts"
    change: "Added placeholder test to prevent empty suite error"
    justification: "Jest requires at least one test per suite"

  - file: "apps/api/src/scripts/analyze.ts"
    change: "Exported getRequiredAnalysisSteps function (line 121)"
    justification: "Enable unit testing of step determination logic"

# Gate decision criteria applied
decision_rationale: |
  Gate set to CONCERNS based on:
  1. TEST-001 (medium severity) - Jest mocking failures need resolution
  2. All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and working
  3. Code architecture and design are excellent
  4. No security or performance concerns
  5. Issues are limited to test infrastructure, not production code

  This is a strong implementation that would receive PASS once test issues are resolved.
  Estimated 1-2 hours of dev effort to address TEST-001 (primary blocker).
