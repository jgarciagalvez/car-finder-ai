# Story 1.2: Local Database Initialization

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a local SQLite database and a simple data access layer set up,
**so that** scraped data can be stored persistently on my machine.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The project includes `sqlite3` and a query builder like `Kysely`.
2. A database schema is defined for a `vehicles` table with columns for all required data.
3. A database service is created that can initialize the database file and schema.
4. The service exposes basic functions like `insertVehicle` and `findVehicleByUrl`.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Monorepo structure established with Turborepo and pnpm workspaces
- TypeScript project references configured for cross-package type sharing
- Shared types package created with comprehensive Vehicle data model
- Build pipeline functional with `pnpm build` and `pnpm type-check`

### Database Architecture
**Database Technology:** SQLite ~5.1.0 - Simple, file-based SQL database for a zero-cost app [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
**Query Builder:** Kysely - Type-safe SQL query builder (specified in AC: 1)
**Pattern:** Repository Pattern - Database interactions handled by dedicated repository layer for abstraction and testability [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

### Data Models and Schema Requirements
**Vehicle Data Model:** Complete Vehicle interface already defined in packages/types [Source: architecture.md#data-models]
**Key Fields for Database:**
- `id: string` - Internal unique identifier (Primary Key)
- `source: VehicleSource` - 'otomoto' | 'olx'
- `sourceId: string` - ID from source site
- `sourceUrl: string` - Unique URL for deduplication (Index needed)
- `sourceCreatedAt: Date` - When ad was published
- Raw scraped data fields (sourceTitle, sourceDescriptionHtml, etc.)
- Processed data fields (title, description, pricePln, priceEur, etc.)
- AI generated fields (all nullable initially)
- User workflow fields (status, personalNotes)
- Timestamps (scrapedAt, createdAt, updatedAt with auto-update trigger)

### Project Structure Specifications
**Database Package Location:** `packages/db/` - Database layer package [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
**Package Structure:**
```
packages/db/
├── src/
│   ├── index.ts          (Main exports)
│   ├── database.ts       (DatabaseService class)
│   ├── schema.ts         (Schema definitions)
│   └── repositories/
│       └── vehicleRepository.ts (Vehicle CRUD operations)
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── .eslintrc.js
```

### Technical Constraints and Requirements
**SQLite Version:** ~5.1.0 as specified in tech stack [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
**TypeScript Integration:** Must use shared types from packages/types [Source: architecture.md#key-developer-standards]
**Repository Pattern:** All DB access through packages/db repository [Source: architecture.md#key-developer-standards]
**Local-First:** Database file stored locally on user's machine [Source: architecture.md#platform-and-infrastructure-choice]

### Core Repository Functions Required
Based on AC: 4 and architecture patterns:
1. **insertVehicle(vehicle: Vehicle): Promise<void>** - Insert new vehicle with deduplication
2. **findVehicleByUrl(sourceUrl: string): Promise<Vehicle | null>** - For deduplication during scraping
3. **findVehicleById(id: string): Promise<Vehicle | null>** - For API endpoints
4. **updateVehicle(id: string, updates: Partial<Vehicle>): Promise<void>** - For status/notes updates
5. **getAllVehicles(): Promise<Vehicle[]>** - For dashboard display

### Database Schema Design
**Primary Table:** `vehicles` with all Vehicle interface fields mapped to appropriate SQL types
**Indexes:** Performance indexes on id (PRIMARY), sourceUrl (UNIQUE), status, createdAt
**Triggers:** Auto-update updatedAt timestamp on record changes
**Constraints:** NOT NULL constraints on required fields, CHECK constraints for enums

### Integration Points
**Type Safety:** Import Vehicle interface from @car-finder/types for consistency
**Monorepo Integration:** Configure as workspace package with proper TypeScript references
**API Integration:** Will be consumed by apps/api for REST endpoints (future stories)

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework:** Jest ~29.7.0 - Standard testing suite [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]
**Testing Strategy:** Unit Tests for complex functions and Integration Tests for core database logic [Source: architecture.md#technical-assumptions]

### Testing Requirements for This Story
**Unit Tests:**
- DatabaseService initialization and configuration
- Schema creation and validation
- Individual repository function logic
- Error handling and edge cases

**Integration Tests:**
- End-to-end database operations (create, read, update)
- Database file creation and schema setup
- Cross-package type integration with @car-finder/types
- Transaction handling and data consistency

### Test File Locations
- Tests co-located with source files using `.test.ts` extensions
- Integration tests in `src/__tests__/` directory
- Mock data and fixtures in `src/__tests__/fixtures/`

### Specific Test Scenarios
- Database initialization with new file
- Vehicle insertion with all required fields
- Deduplication via findVehicleByUrl
- Update operations maintaining data integrity
- Error handling for invalid data and connection issues
