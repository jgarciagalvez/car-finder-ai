# Story 1.5: Main Ingestion Pipeline

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a main script that orchestrates the entire data ingestion process,
**so that** I can run a single command to find and store all new vehicle listings.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A main script (`packages/scripts/ingest.ts`) is created.
2. The script reads search URLs from a configuration file.
3. It uses the `ScraperService` to get a list of individual vehicle URLs.
4. For each new URL, it uses the `ScraperService`, `ParserService`, and database service to save the new vehicle data.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create packages/scripts directory and ingest.ts script (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create packages/scripts directory in monorepo structure
  - [x] Initialize ingest.ts with proper TypeScript configuration
  - [x] Add necessary imports for ScraperService, ParserService, and database services
  - [x] Set up proper error handling and logging structure
- [x] Create search configuration file and URL management (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create search-config.json file with Otomoto and OLX search URLs
  - [x] Implement configuration loading and validation
  - [x] Add support for multiple search criteria and URL patterns
  - [x] Include proper TypeScript interfaces for search configuration
- [x] Implement search results scraping workflow (AC: 3)
  - [x] Use ScraperService to fetch search results pages
  - [x] Use ParserService to extract individual vehicle URLs from search pages
  - [x] Handle pagination for multi-page search results
  - [x] Implement deduplication logic for URLs found across multiple sources
- [x] Implement individual vehicle data ingestion (AC: 4)
  - [x] For each new URL, use ScraperService to fetch vehicle detail page
  - [x] Use ParserService to extract complete vehicle data from detail pages
  - [x] Transform parsed data to match Vehicle interface from packages/types
  - [x] Use database service to check for existing vehicles and insert new ones
  - [x] Handle PLN to EUR price conversion during data transformation
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling and logging
  - [x] Implement retry logic for failed scraping attempts
  - [x] Add detailed logging for each step of the ingestion process
  - [x] Handle network errors, parsing failures, and database errors gracefully
  - [x] Create summary report of ingestion results (new vehicles found, errors encountered)
- [x] Create unit tests for ingestion pipeline components (Testing Requirements)
  - [x] Test configuration loading and validation
  - [x] Test URL deduplication logic
  - [x] Test data transformation and Vehicle interface compliance
  - [x] Test error handling scenarios
- [x] Create integration tests for full ingestion workflow (Testing Requirements)
  - [x] Test end-to-end ingestion with mock data
  - [x] Test database integration and data persistence
  - [x] Test interaction between ScraperService and ParserService

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4 completion, the ParserService now supports:
- Hybrid parsing with JSON extraction from Otomoto __NEXT_DATA__ and CSS fallback for OLX
- Auto-detection of search vs detail page types
- Comprehensive data normalization including price conversion and text cleaning
- Robust error handling for malformed data

### Data Models
**Vehicle Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Complete Vehicle interface defined in packages/types with all required fields
- Includes source tracking (otomoto/olx), scraped data, processed data, AI fields, and user workflow data
- Price fields: pricePln (number) and priceEur (number) for currency conversion
- Status field: VehicleStatus enum with workflow states
- Timestamps: scrapedAt, createdAt, updatedAt for tracking

**SellerInfo Interface** [Source: architecture.md#data-models]:
- Nested interface for seller information including name, id, type, location, memberSince
- SellerType enum: 'private' | 'company' | null

### API Specifications
No direct API endpoints required for this story - this is a background script that populates the database.

### Component Specifications
**ScraperService Integration** [Source: Story 1.3 completion]:
- Use existing ScraperService.scrapeUrl(url: string) method
- Service includes respectful delays and headless browser best practices
- Returns full rendered HTML content for parsing

**ParserService Integration** [Source: Story 1.4 completion]:
- Use ParserService.parseHtml(html: string, siteKey: string, expectedPageType?: string) method
- Service auto-detects search vs detail page types
- Returns structured data with page type information
- Supports both Otomoto JSON extraction and OLX CSS parsing

### File Locations
**Script Location** [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]:
- Create packages/scripts/ingest.ts as main ingestion script
- Follow monorepo structure with packages directory for shared scripts

**Configuration File**:
- Create search-config.json in project root alongside parser-schema.json
- Include search URLs for both Otomoto.pl and OLX.pl with configurable parameters

**Database Integration** [Source: architecture.md#backend-architecture]:
- Use packages/db repository pattern for all database operations
- Access through vehicleRepository.ts for Vehicle entity operations
- Database service should expose insertVehicle and findVehicleByUrl functions

### Testing Requirements
**Unit Testing** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Jest ~29.7.0 for unit testing framework
- Test files should be co-located: packages/scripts/__tests__/ingest.test.ts
- Focus on testing individual functions and error handling scenarios

**Integration Testing** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Create integration tests that test the full workflow with mock data
- Test database integration and service interactions
- Use test fixtures for consistent testing data

### Technical Constraints
**Monorepo Structure** [Source: architecture.md#repository-structure]:
- Follow Turborepo monorepo pattern with packages and apps directories
- Use shared types from packages/types for consistency
- Ensure proper TypeScript configuration and module resolution

**Local-First Architecture** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- Script runs entirely on local machine with no external dependencies except Gemini API
- Use local SQLite database for data persistence
- Configuration files stored locally in project root

**Schema-Driven Parser** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- Leverage existing parser-schema.json for parsing configuration
- Parser service handles both search results and detail page parsing
- No hardcoded parsing logic - all driven by external configuration

### Testing
**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Unit tests: packages/scripts/__tests__/ingest.test.ts
- Integration tests: packages/scripts/__tests__/ingest.integration.test.ts

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Jest ~29.7.0 as primary testing framework
- Follow existing patterns from ScraperService and ParserService tests
- Include both unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for full workflow

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test configuration loading and validation
- Test URL deduplication and data transformation logic
- Test error handling for network failures, parsing errors, and database issues
- Test integration between all services (Scraper, Parser, Database)
- Mock external dependencies for reliable testing
