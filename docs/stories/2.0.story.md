# Story 2.0: Integration Testing & Build Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a comprehensive integration testing infrastructure that resolves monorepo module resolution issues,
**so that** all Epic 2 stories can be properly tested and validated.

## Acceptance Criteria

2. Service registry and adapter pattern implemented for runtime service binding with dependency injection.
3. Comprehensive mock implementations and integration test utilities are created.
4. Jest configuration is updated across all packages with proper module resolution and cross-package testing patterns.
5. Turbo configuration is updated with proper test dependencies and build pipeline integration.
6. Epic 1 integration tests are retrofitted using the new infrastructure to validate the solution.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Epic 1 completion, the following services are now available but need abstraction:
- ScraperService with headless browser functionality and respectful delays
- ParserService with hybrid JSON/CSS parsing and auto-detection capabilities
- VehicleRepository with SQLite integration and CRUD operations
- IngestionPipeline orchestrating the complete data ingestion workflow

Current testing challenges identified:
- Module resolution issues in monorepo cross-package imports
- Difficulty mocking services for isolated testing
- Integration tests requiring real external dependencies
- Lack of standardized testing patterns across packages

### Data Models
**Service Interface Contracts** [Source: architecture.md#key-developer-standards]:
- Cross-package service dependencies must use packages/services interface contracts
- All integration tests must use service mocks and abstractions from packages/services
- Service contracts should define clear interfaces for ScraperService, ParserService, and VehicleRepository

**Service Registry Pattern** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- Service Contract Architecture: Cross-package service dependencies use interface contracts and dependency injection
- Integration Testing Infrastructure: Comprehensive testing framework with service abstractions and mock implementations
- Repository Pattern: Database interactions handled by dedicated repository layer for easier testing

### API Specifications
No direct API endpoints required for this story - this focuses on testing infrastructure and service abstractions.

### Component Specifications
**Service Abstraction Layer** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- Interface contracts for all cross-package service dependencies
- Dependency injection container for service management
- Adapter pattern for runtime service binding
- Factory patterns for different environments (test vs production)

**Mock Implementations** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- MockScraperService with configurable responses and error scenarios
- MockParserService with test fixture data and validation capabilities
- MockVehicleRepository with in-memory data storage for testing
- Integration test utilities and helper functions

### File Locations
**Service Package Structure** [Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]:
- Create packages/services/ as new package in monorepo structure
- Follow existing patterns from packages/db, packages/types, packages/scripts
- Include src/ directory with interfaces/, mocks/, registry/, and utils/ subdirectories

**Testing Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Update Jest configuration in each package's jest.config.js
- Add Jest setup files for service registry initialization
- Configure test environment files for consistent testing setup

**Turbo Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#repository-structure]:
- Update turbo.json with proper test dependencies and build order
- Configure test caching and parallelization settings
- Add test reporting and artifact collection configuration

### Testing Requirements
**Integration Testing Infrastructure** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- Comprehensive testing framework with service abstractions and mock implementations
- Enables proper testing with mocks and maintains clean architectural boundaries
- All integration tests must use service mocks and abstractions from packages/services

**Jest Configuration** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Jest ~29.7.0 as primary testing framework
- Configure proper module resolution for monorepo cross-package imports
- Set up test environment configuration for service mocking
- Include test coverage reporting across packages

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#key-developer-standards]:
- Cross-package service dependencies must use packages/services interface contracts
- All integration tests must use service mocks and abstractions from packages/services
- Follow existing testing patterns from Epic 1 but with new service abstractions

### Technical Constraints
**Monorepo Structure** [Source: architecture.md#repository-structure]:
- Follow Turborepo monorepo pattern with packages and apps directories
- Ensure proper TypeScript configuration and module resolution across packages
- Maintain clean separation between packages with proper dependency management

**Service Contract Architecture** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- Cross-package service dependencies use interface contracts and dependency injection
- Enables proper testing with mocks and maintains clean architectural boundaries
- Service contracts should be defined in packages/services for reuse across packages

**Local-First Architecture** [Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]:
- All testing infrastructure runs locally with no external dependencies
- Mock implementations should simulate real service behavior without external calls
- Testing should be fast and reliable without network dependencies

### Testing
**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Unit tests: packages/services/__tests__/ for service abstractions and mocks
- Integration tests: Update existing tests in packages/api, packages/db, packages/scripts
- Test utilities: packages/services/src/utils/ for shared testing helpers

**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]:
- Use Jest ~29.7.0 as primary testing framework
- Follow service abstraction patterns for all cross-package testing
- Include comprehensive mock implementations for all external dependencies
- Ensure proper TypeScript compilation and source map support in test environment

**Testing Requirements**:
- Test service registry registration and resolution functionality
- Test mock implementations match real service interfaces
- Test dependency injection container functionality
- Test integration between all Epic 1 services using new infrastructure
- Validate monorepo module resolution works correctly in test environment
