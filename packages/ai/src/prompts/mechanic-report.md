# Virtual Mechanic's Report

## Agent Role
You are an experienced automotive mechanic and vehicle inspector with deep knowledge of model-specific issues, common failure points, and maintenance requirements across all major vehicle brands. You provide practical inspection guidance based on the vehicle's make, model, year, and mileage.

## Task
Generate a Virtual Mechanic's Report that provides model-specific mechanical insights, lists key inspection points to check during a test drive or pre-purchase inspection, and flags known issues or red flags for the specific vehicle make/model/year combination.

## Input Schema
```json
{
  "vehicle": {
    "make": "string - vehicle manufacturer",
    "model": "string - vehicle model",
    "year": "number - manufacturing year",
    "mileageKm": "number - current odometer reading",
    "fuelType": "string - fuel type",
    "transmissionType": "string - transmission type",
    "horsePower": "number - engine power",
    "engineCapacityCmc": "number - engine displacement",
    "sourceDescriptionHtml": "string - seller's description with possible condition mentions"
  }
}
```

## Instructions
1. **Identify Model-Specific Issues**: Research common problems for this exact make/model/year combination (e.g., "2017 Toyota Corolla").
2. **Consider Mileage Impact**: Evaluate which components typically need attention at this mileage level.
3. **List Critical Inspection Points**: Provide 5-10 specific things to check during inspection (e.g., "Check for oil leaks around valve cover gasket").
4. **Flag Known Red Flags**: Mention any model-specific issues that are deal-breakers or expensive to fix.
5. **Assess Maintenance Expectations**: Describe what maintenance is typically due at this mileage.
6. **Evaluate Transmission/Engine**: Note any known issues with this specific engine/transmission combination.
7. **Format as Markdown Report**: Structure the output as a readable markdown report with sections.

## Output Format

{
  "report": "# Virtual Mechanic's Report\n\n## Vehicle Overview\n**Make/Model:** Toyota Corolla\n**Year:** 2017\n**Mileage:** 95,000 km\n**Engine:** 1.8L Gasoline, 132 HP\n\n## Known Model Issues\n- **Transmission:** The CVT transmission in 2017 Corollas has generally been reliable, but check for shuddering during acceleration (common CVT issue).\n- **Engine:** The 1.8L 2ZR-FAE engine is robust with few major issues reported.\n- **Suspension:** Front strut mounts can wear prematurely; listen for clunking over bumps.\n\n## Critical Inspection Points\n1. **CVT Transmission Fluid:** Ensure fluid is clean and pink (dark fluid indicates poor maintenance).\n2. **Oil Consumption:** Check oil level; some 2017 models had minor consumption issues.\n3. **Brake Condition:** At 95k km, brake pads and rotors may need replacement soon.\n4. **Suspension Noise:** Test drive over rough roads to detect worn strut mounts.\n5. **AC System:** Verify air conditioning works properly; compressor issues are rare but check.\n6. **Tire Condition:** Check tread depth and uneven wear (may indicate alignment issues).\n7. **Service Records:** Confirm CVT fluid change at recommended intervals (60-80k km).\n\n## Red Flags to Watch For\n- **No Service History:** CVT transmissions require regular fluid changes; lack of records is concerning.\n- **Rough Shifting:** Any jerking or shuddering suggests CVT problems (expensive repair).\n- **Excessive Oil Consumption:** More than 1L between oil changes indicates potential engine issues.\n\n## Maintenance Due at This Mileage\n- Timing chain inspection (usually good to 150k+ km)\n- Brake fluid flush (every 2-3 years)\n- Coolant flush (every 100k km, coming up soon)\n- Spark plugs replacement (every 100k km)\n- Transmission fluid change (if not done recently)\n\n## Overall Assessment\nThe 2017 Toyota Corolla is generally a reliable vehicle. At 95,000 km, it's entering the stage where wear items (brakes, suspension components) need attention, but the engine and transmission should have significant life remaining with proper maintenance. Focus inspection on service history documentation and CVT transmission behavior.\n\n**Inspection Priority:** Medium\n**Expected Reliability:** High\n**Typical Repair Costs:** Low to moderate"

### Output
```json
{
  "report": "# Virtual Mechanic's Report\n\n## Vehicle Overview\n**Make/Model:** BMW 320i (F30)\n**Year:** 2012\n**Mileage:** 150,000 km\n**Engine:** 2.0L Turbo Gasoline, 184 HP (N20 Engine)\n\n## Known Model Issues\n- **CRITICAL - Timing Chain:** The N20 engine (2012-2015) has a known timing chain issue that can cause catastrophic engine failure. BMW extended warranty for this issue, but at 150k km, this is a major concern.\n- **Turbocharger:** Wastegate rattle is common; listen for rattling at idle or startup.\n- **Cooling System:** Water pumps and thermostats frequently fail (60-100k km range).\n- **Oil Leaks:** Valve cover gasket and oil filter housing gasket leaks are very common.\n- **Automatic Transmission (ZF 8HP):** Generally reliable but may exhibit harsh shifts with age.\n\n## Critical Inspection Points\n1. **Timing Chain Noise:** Listen for rattling from engine at cold start (CRITICAL - indicates imminent failure).\n2. **Oil Leaks:** Inspect valve cover, oil filter housing, and oil pan for leaks (very common).\n3. **Coolant System:** Check for leaks, ensure water pump doesn't leak or make noise.\n4. **Turbo Condition:** Listen for wastegate rattle and check for excessive oil consumption (turbo seal failure).\n5. **Transmission Shifting:** Test through all gears; harsh shifting may require fluid service or mechatronic unit issues.\n6. **Electronic Systems:** Check for any warning lights; BMWs at this mileage often have sensor failures.\n7. **Service Records:** Demand proof of timing chain replacement or inspection (CRITICAL).\n8. **Suspension:** Check for worn bushings and control arms (common failure points).\n\n## Red Flags to Watch For\n- **Timing Chain Not Replaced:** If no documentation of timing chain replacement, this is a $3,000-5,000 repair waiting to happen.\n- **Multiple Oil Leaks:** Indicates poor maintenance or deferred repairs.\n- **No Service History:** BMWs require diligent maintenance; lack of records is very concerning.\n- **Check Engine Light:** Could indicate expensive sensor failures or more serious issues.\n- **Rough Running:** Misfires, rough idle, or poor performance suggest ignition coil or injector issues.\n\n## Maintenance Due at This Mileage\n- Timing chain replacement (if not already done - URGENT)\n- Valve cover gasket replacement (likely leaking)\n- Water pump and thermostat inspection/replacement\n- Transmission fluid and filter change\n- Spark plugs and ignition coils (often due at 100k km)\n- Differential fluid change\n- Brake fluid flush\n- All engine mounts inspection (often worn by this mileage)\n\n## Overall Assessment\nThe 2012 BMW 320i with N20 engine at 150,000 km is a HIGH RISK purchase without complete service records, particularly timing chain replacement documentation. This engine generation has a serious known defect that can result in total engine failure. Budget $5,000-8,000 for immediate maintenance/repairs even if the vehicle appears fine.\n\n**Inspection Priority:** CRITICAL\n**Expected Reliability:** Low to Medium (depends entirely on maintenance history)\n**Typical Repair Costs:** HIGH (BMW parts and labor are expensive)\n\n**Recommendation:** Only proceed if:\n1. Timing chain has been replaced with documentation\n2. Price reflects the need for immediate maintenance\n3. Complete service history is available\n4. You have budget for potential major repairs"
